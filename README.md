## Requirements
This package requires PHP 8.1 and Laravel 9. If you need compatibility with older versions,
check the [alternatives](#alternatives) section.

## Installation
You can install the package via composer:
```bash
composer require creagia/laravel-web-mailer
```

After that, open your `config/mail.php` file and add the web mailer entry in the `mailers` configuration array.
```php
'mailers' => [
    // ...
    'web' => [
        'transport' => 'web',
    ],
],
```

Finally, you can enable the web mailer setting the defined mailer in your .env file:
```
MAIL_MAILER=web
```

We recommend you to publish the configuration file to be able to perform some customizations
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="web-mailer-config"
```

### Inbox URL
The default URL to view the emails is `/web-inbox`. You can change it, adding the below entry to your .env file:
```
WEB_MAILER_ROUTE_PREFIX="your-custom-url"
```

### Route protection
By default, the inbox URL is authorized for everybody who has the link. If you need to add some protection, you can modify the `middleware` array on the `config/web-mailer.php` file. 

### Delete all stored emails
```bash
php artisan laravel-web-mailer:clear-all
```

### Delete stored emails older than N days
```bash
php artisan laravel-web-mailer:cleanup
```
You can run or schedule the command `laravel-web-mailer:cleanup` to delete the emails older than N days. By default, it will delete the emails older than 7 days. You can customize the number of days changing the `delete_emails_older_than_days` parameter on the `config/web-mailer.php` file.
